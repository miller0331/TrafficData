# Traffic Data

This file contains the traffic data used in the paper "Traffic Equilibrium Considering Heterogeneity across Electric Vehicles". The topology of the transportation network is shown in figure 11. Readers can refer to this figure for the ID of the origin and destination. Note that the trip rate is set as 60. The EV number in Figure 12 in the paper is divided by the trip rate.
